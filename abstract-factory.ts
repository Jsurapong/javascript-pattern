// In this example, the Button and Dialog interfaces represent the products and the factory, respectively.
//  The WindowsButton and MacButton objects are the concrete products that implement the Button interface.
//  The WindowsDialog and MacDialog objects are the concrete factories that implement the Dialog interface and create the appropriate button product.

// The factory function is the abstract factory that takes an os argument and returns the appropriate concrete factory based on the operating system.
// The client code can work with the factory function and the returned concrete factory without needing to be aware of the underlying concrete products, as long as the concrete factory implements the required Dialog interface.

// This is the essence of the Abstract Factory pattern: it provides a way to encapsulate a group of related products and to create objects without specifying their concrete classes.
// The abstract factory can be used to generate families of related products that are designed to work together, and it provides a level of abstraction between the client code and the concrete products.
